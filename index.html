            <h2 class="secHeading">ADVENTURE TIME !</h2>
            <p class="introtext">An adventure is an exciting experience that is typically a bold, sometimes risky, undertaking. Adventures may be activities with some potential for physical danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving,river rafting or participating in extreme sports.Adventures are often undertaken in order to achieve a greater goal or in the the pursuit of knowledge.<br><br>

            Adventure is good for your mind and body, but with a little slip of alertness, things could turn out to be undesirable. Nobody would ever want an adventure trip to turn out hazardous and threatening; therefore, it must be ensured that safety has been given the priority.

            <p class="text">Paragliding is a type of extreme sport found in the early 1980s by people interested in aerial sports, and it allows one to run off the slopes with free parachutes.

            When the weather is too windy, you can lose your way in the direction of the wind and you mostly likely wonâ€™t be able to control yourself.

            </div>
            <div class="content">
            <p class="text">Surfing is the sport of riding waves in an upright or prone position. Surfers catch the ocean, river, or man-made waves and glide across the surface of the water until they break and lose their energy.
            
            <br><br>
            The concept is simple, but the practice is not. Surfers paddle or are towed in to the surf line, the area of open water where waves break as they near a coast.
